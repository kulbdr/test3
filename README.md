# Hangman Game in Flutter

The application represents a basic Hangman game which runs through Flutter development technology. A randomly picked word appears from a pre-defined list for the player to deduce through letter suggestions. Players lose or win the game according to their incorrect letter guesses which the game system tracks.

## Features

- Random word selection from a list.
- Display underscores for unguessed letters.
- Track wrong guesses and limit the number of incorrect guesses (6).
- Display a message when the player wins or loses.
- Restart the game after a win or loss.


## Game Rules

- The player guesses one letter at a time.
- Each wrong guess counts towards the Hangman drawing (although currently the drawing is not implemented).
- The player wins when all letters of the word are guessed correctly.
- The game ends when the player reaches 6 incorrect guesses.
